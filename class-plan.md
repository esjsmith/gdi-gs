# Class Plan

## CSS
 
  1. Have class open my codepen.io page: [codepen.io/espwan](codepen.io/espwan)
  2. Introduce CSS by having them change the fill property on shapes in Circles SVG
     Must show standard colors page on GDI lecture notes
  3. Move on to concept that classes and IDs can be anything, not just the name of 
     the object, like .st0
  4. Introduce rgb colors using [this link](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp)
     This needs the concept of 256 bits, etc.
  5. Use rgb colors to introduce hex values
  6. Change alignment to move Panda around page or to grow and shrink Panda


## HTML

  1. Get a basic webpage going on sublime
  2. Import the panda as an `img` tag
  3. `h1` heading for panda
  4. `title` for page containing panda
  5. `p` description of panda below panda
  6. Find another picture on the web and put into webpage by `img` tag
  7. repeat the `h1` and `p` for that image.
  8. Style it to look like GDI page
